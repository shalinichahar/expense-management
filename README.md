- **User Authoriztion**: The process of checking of depending on your status/credentials , what you are allowed to do.
- **Form Validation**: Both the login and registration forms include client-side and server-side validation to check the correctness of input data, such as email format and mandatory fields, enhancing the application's reliability and user experience.
### 2. Expense Form
- **Data Entry**: Users can input details about their expenses through a user-friendly form interface. This form allows the entry of essential expense attributes such as date, amount, category, and a description.
- **Validation**: The expense form validates inputs to ensure data integrity, such as checking for valid numerical inputs for the amount and non-empty strings for required fields.
### 3. Expense Table with CRUD Operations
- **View Expenses**: Users can view a list of entered expenses in a tabular format, which includes all details such as date, amount, category, and description.
- **Update and Delete**: Each entry in the expense table includes options to edit or delete the expense, allowing for easy management of expense records.
- **Pagination and Sorting**: The table supports pagination and sorting to help users easily navigate and organize their expense data, making the interface scalable for a large number of entries.
### 4. Highcharts Integration
- **Data Visualization**: Integrates JS Highcharts Library to provide a graphical representation of expenses. This feature allows users to visualize their spending patterns over time and by category through dynamic pie charts.
- **Interactive Charts**: Users can interact with the chart to get a more detailed view of each category's expenses, helping them understand their spending habits better.
### 5. Responsive Design
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface**: The application is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
### Additional Information
- **Technologies Used**: React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, PostgreSQL for database management, JWT for authentication, and Highcharts for data visualization.
- **Security Features**: Includes secure handling of user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and hashed passwords to protect user information.
